## What is INSI?
INSI is an Insulin to Carbohydrate Converter. 

## Why was INSI created?
INSI was created to help busy parents manage their childs type-1 diabetes quickly and more effiecently.

Reduces TIME and ENERGY into calculating Carbohydrates in every meal to give correct Insulin for each meal! INSI provides personal Carb : Insulin conversions [for the specified meal] giving itâ€™s user(s) accurate Insulin results!

I created INSI with my 6 year old nephew in mind. He recently found out he has type-1 dibetes and it has been an adjustment for the family. With two younger brothers, meal time becomes a more time consuming event- looking up the carbohydrates in every food (per amount eaten) every meal and calculate his always changing insulin.

The goal of INSI was to give the caregiver a quick, effecent, and accurate result for food consumed at each meal. The user is promted to create their INSI profile on account creation with basic information and their insulin conversions for each meal: Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner. This information is used on the Calculate page.

## What does Insulin Conversion mean? 
A ratio that specifies the number of grams of carbohydrates covered by each unit of insulin. This ratio can differ per meal: breakfast can be one conversion while dinner is another. These ratios can also change as the child grows older etc. To get the correct amount of insulin per meal you have to accurately calculate and log every single item you ate and divide that by the specific meal ratio.
